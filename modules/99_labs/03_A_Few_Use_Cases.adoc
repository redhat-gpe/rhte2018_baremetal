== Use Cases 

=== A Few use cases to Consider RedHat OpenStack as the IaaS Provider for OpenShift

* End to end Infrastructure Orchestration in tandem with Container Orchestration.

* Hybrid Model (On Prem + Public ) to Manage the cost.

**  Eg: Compute intensive and less secure OpenShift tasks (eg: build) can execute on  `private cloud` Cluster.

* Option to provide the `right` compute resources to the Workload.  (Deep Learning Tasks on GPU nodes)

* Multiple Storage Options via `cinder` storageclass.

* Option to Deploy OpenShift Container Storage on Baremetal nodes provisioned using Ironic.

* Non-Containerized services can run on VM/BM managed by OpenStack in the same security domain.
